# PR review process

- Any PR must have an entry in the corresponding changelog in a separate commit (CHANGELOG.MD file)
- Changelog follow these guidelines: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.md
- Each release branch (2018.1, 2018.2...) have a unique Changelog file
- when backporting, don't backport the changelog commit but update the branch changelog manually
- (optional) add reviewver from doc team
- Any more complex description of a change with future need to go in a release note file
