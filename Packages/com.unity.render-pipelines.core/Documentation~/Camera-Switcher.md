# Camera Switcher

The **CameraSwitcher** component allows you to define a List of Cameras in the Scene and then use the Debug Window to switch between them in Play Mode. This is useful when you want a set of different fixed views for profiling purposes where you need to guarantee that the Camera view is in the same position between sessions.
