## [5.2.0] - 2018-11-27

## [5.1.0] - 2018-11-19
### Added
- Added a define for determining if any instancing path is taken.

### Changed
- The Core SRP package is no longer in preview.

## [5.0.0-preview] - 2018-10-18
### Changed
- XRGraphicConfig has been changed from a read-write control of XRSettings to XRGraphics, a read-only accessor to XRSettings. This improves consistency of XR behavior between the legacy render pipeline and SRP.
- XRGraphics members have been renamed to match XRSettings, and XRGraphics has been modified to only contain accessors potentially useful to SRP
- You can now have up to 16 additional shadow-casting lights.
### Fixed
- LWRP no longer executes shadow passes when there are no visible shadow casters in a Scene. Previously, this made the Scene render as too dark, overall.

### Added
- Space transform functions are now defined in `ShaderLibrary/SpaceTransforms.hlsl`.
### Changed
- Removed setting shader inclue path via old API, use package shader include paths
