# Graphics Tests Framework

This package provides a foundation for writing tests for Graphics features in Unity projects.

Currently it contains:

* ImageAssert, for doing image renders and comparisons with reference images
* Automatic collection and deployment of reference images
* Automatic generation of tests from scenes in the project

It's currently a bit rough, but as improvments to Unity's test framework are made we should be able to make it nicer, as well as expand the functionality it offers.

See [the Documentation](Documentation/com.unity.testframework.graphics.md) for more information.
