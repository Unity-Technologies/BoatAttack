# Master Preview

## Description

The **Master Preview** displays a representation of the shader on the active **Render Pipeline**. It updates in real-time and automatically updates to display any changes you make in the [Shader Graph](Shader-Graph.md). The title bar of the **Master Preview** displays the name of the current shader.

The **Master Preview** can be moved to anywhere in the [Shader Graph Window](Shader-Graph-Window.md) and will automatically move with the nearest corner of that window.

### Preview Mesh

You can rotate the preview mesh by holding left mouse button and dragging on the **Master Preview** and you can scale it by using the scroll wheel. The preview mesh can be changed by right clicking on the **Master Preview**. Here you can select from any primitive mesh types or select a custom mesh.
