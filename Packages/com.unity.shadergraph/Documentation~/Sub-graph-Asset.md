# Sub Graph Asset

## Description

The **Sub Graph Asset** is a new **Asset** type introduced with the [Shader Graph](Shader-Graph.md). A **Sub Graph Asset** defines a [Sub Graph](Sub-graph.md). This is different to a [Shader Graph](Shader-Graph.md). You can create a **Sub Graph Asset** from the [Project Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html.md) from the **Create** menu via **Sub Graph** in the **Shader** sub-menu.

You can open the [Shader Graph Window](Shader-Graph-Window.md) by double clicking a **Sub Graph Asset** or by clicking **Open Shader Editor** in the [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) when the **Sub Graph Asset** is selected.
