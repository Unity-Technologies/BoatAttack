# Create Node Menu

## Description

The **Create Node Menu** is how to create [Nodes](Node.md) in **Shader Graph**. To open the **Create Node Menu** either right click on the workspace in the [Shader Graph Window](Shader-Graph-Window.md) and select **Create Node** or press spacebar.

At the top of the **Create Node Menu** is a search bar. You can search for a node by typing any part of its name in the search field.

All [Nodes](Node.md) that are available in **Shader Graph** are listed in the **Create Node Menu** categorised by their function. Any user created [Sub-graphs](Sub-graph.md) are also available in the **Create Node Menu** under **Sub-graph Assets**.

Selecting a [Node](Node.md) in the **Create Node Menu** will add it to the workspace.

### Contextual Create Node Menu

A contextual **Create Node Menu** filters the [Nodes](Node.md) available to show only those that use the [Data Type](Data-Types.md) of a selected edge. It will list every available [Port](Port.md) on these [Nodes](Node.md) that matches that [Data Type](Data-Types.md).

You can open a contextual **Create Node Menu** by dragging an [Edge](Edge.md) from a [Port](Port.md) with left mouse button and releasing it in an empty area of the workspace.
