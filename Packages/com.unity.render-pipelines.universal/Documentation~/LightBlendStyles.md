# Light Blend Styles

![](images\image_38.png)

__Blend Styles__ determine the way a particular Light interacts with Sprites in the Scene. All Lights in the Scene must pick from one of the available Blend Styles. The UniversalRP 2D Asset can currently contain a total of four different Light Blend Styles, starting with the 'Default' Blend Style being available.

| **Property**         | **Function**                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name                 | The name that appears when choosing a Blend Style for a Light2D. |
| Mask Texture Channel | Which mask channel to use when applying this Blend Style to a Sprite. |
| Render Texture Scale | Scale for the internal render texture created for this Blend Style. |
| Blend Mode           | What blending mode the Light2D uses when this Blend Style is selected. |



## Blend Mode

Blend Modes controls the way a Sprite is lit by light. The following examples show the four predefined Blend Modes:

| ![Original reference](images\image_40.png) | ![Multiply](images\image_41.png)    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Original Sprite                            | Multiply                            |
| ![Additive](images\image_42.png)           | ![Subtractive](images\image_43.png) |
| Additive                                   | Subtractive                         |



## Custom Blend Modes

All of the Blend Modes available can be expressed with Custom Blend Factors. The factors for the existing Blend Modes are as follows:

- Multiplicative

- - Modulate = 1
  - Additive = 0

- Additive

- - Modulate = 0
  - Additive = 1

- Subtractive

- - Modulate = 0
  - Additive = -1



## Mask Texture Channel

Masks control where Lights can affect a Sprite. There are 4 channels to select from as the mask channel - Red, Blue, Green, and Alpha. In a mask max value means full light, min value means no light.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Original Rock Color                             | Rock with a mask                                       |
| ![Additive Light Blending](images\image_47.png) | ![Masked Additive Light Blending](images\image_48.png) |
| Additive Light Blending                         | Additive Light Blending with a mask                    |



## Render Texture Scale

Render Texture Scale adjusts the size of the internal render Texture used for a given Blend Mode. Lowering the Render Texture Scale can increase performance and decrease memory usage for Scenes that contain large Lights. Lowering the Texture Scale to too low a value may cause visual artefacts or a shimmering effect when there is motion in the Scene.
